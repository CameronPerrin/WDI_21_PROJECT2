A tiny \r\n               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \r\n               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \r\n               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \r\n               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \r\n               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\r\n\r\n               INT.

Both robots are \r\n               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \r\n               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \r\n               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \r\n               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \r\n               surface of an Art Deco design.\r\n\r\n               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Did you hear that?

Rebel spaceships, \r\n                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first \r\n                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\r\n\r\n                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \r\n                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \r\n                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough \r\n                    power to destroy an entire planet.\r\n\r\n                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \r\n                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \r\n                    the stolen plans that can save her people and \r\n                    restore freedom to the galaxy...\r\n\r\n               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \r\n               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \r\n               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \r\n               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \r\n               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \r\n               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \r\n               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\r\n\r\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\r\n\r\n               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\r\n               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \r\n               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \r\n               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \r\n               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \r\n               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \r\n               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \r\n               surface of an Art Deco design.\r\n\r\n               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Did you hear that? They've shut down \r\n                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed \r\n                         for sure. This is madness!\r\n\r\n               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \r\n               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         We're doomed!\r\n\r\n               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \r\n               only another robot could understand.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         There'll be no escape for the Princess \r\n                         this time.\r\n\r\n               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \r\n               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment \r\n               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         What's that?\r\n\r\n               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\r\n\r\n               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \r\n               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \r\n               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\r\n\r\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\r\n\r\n               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \r\n               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \r\n               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \r\n               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.\r\n\r\n               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \r\n               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \r\n               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \r\n               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \r\n               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \r\n               arms and faces.\r\n\r\n               An explosion hits near the robots.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I should have known better than to \r\n                         trust the logic of a half-sized \r\n                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...\r\n\r\n               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \r\n               around the two hapless robots.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\r\n\r\n               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \r\n               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \r\n               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \r\n               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \r\n               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \r\n               lad with a prize-winning smile.\r\n\r\n               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \r\n               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \r\n               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \r\n               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \r\n               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \r\n               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \r\n               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \r\n               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \r\n               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \r\n               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \r\n               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \r\n               tiny robot to follow him.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you \r\n                         waiting for?! Get in gear!\r\n\r\n               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \r\n               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \r\n               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \r\n               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \r\n               madly.\r\n\r\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\r\n\r\n               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \r\n               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \r\n               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \r\n               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \r\n               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \r\n               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \r\n               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \r\n               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \r\n               in a frenzied panic.\r\n\r\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\r\n\r\n               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  \r\n               Artoo makes beeping sounds.\r\n\r\n               INT.

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET\r\n\r\n               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange \r\n               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures \r\n               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \r\n               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \r\n               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \r\n               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\r\n\r\n               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \r\n               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \r\n               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \r\n               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \r\n               narrow path.\r\n\r\n               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \r\n               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \r\n               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \r\n               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \r\n               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \r\n               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \r\n               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \r\n               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \r\n               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \r\n               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \r\n               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \r\n               the trail.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\r\n\r\n               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\r\n               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \r\n               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \r\n               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \r\n               is sucked into the giant machine.\r\n\r\n               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \r\n               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\r\n\r\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\r\n\r\n               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \r\n               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \r\n               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty \r\n               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \r\n               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \r\n               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \r\n               of the chamber.\r\n\r\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\r\n\r\n               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \r\n               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \r\n               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, \r\n               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \r\n               out from the gloom.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!\r\n\r\n               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\r\n\r\n               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent \r\n               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain \r\n               ridge.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY\r\n\r\n               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\r\n               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. \r\n               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks \r\n                         go off in this direction.\r\n\r\n               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand \r\n               and gives it to the first trooper.\r\n\r\n                                     SECOND TROOPER\r\n                         Look, sir -- droids.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES\r\n\r\n               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.\r\n\r\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER\r\n\r\n               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped \r\n               prison chamber.

Wake up!\r\n\r\n               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, \r\n               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  \r\n               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights \r\n               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long \r\n               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding \r\n               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the \r\n               odd assortment of robots.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         We're doomed.\r\n\r\n               A Jawa starts moving toward them.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Do you think they'll melt us down?\r\n\r\n               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Don't shoot!

TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their \r\n               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of \r\n               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small \r\n               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground \r\n               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small \r\n               adobe block house.\r\n\r\n               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening \r\n               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. \r\n               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting \r\n               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils \r\n               should be.\r\n\r\n               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, \r\n               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are \r\n               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \r\n               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \r\n               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \r\n               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \r\n               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\r\n\r\n               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \r\n               homestead.

Luke and the two \r\n               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the \r\n               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Uncle Owen...\r\n\r\n                                     OWEN\r\n                         Yeah?\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. \r\n                         Look!\r\n\r\n                                     OWEN\r\n                              (to the head Jawa)\r\n                         Hey, what're you trying to push on \r\n                         us?\r\n\r\n               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked \r\n               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract \r\n               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps \r\n               Luke on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                              (pointing to Artoo)\r\n                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is \r\n                         in prime condition.

We'll take \r\n                         that one.\r\n\r\n               With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged \r\n               astro-droid for Artoo.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Yeah, take it away.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very \r\n                         pleased with that one, sir. He really \r\n                         is in first-class condition. I've \r\n                         worked with him before. Here he comes.\r\n\r\n               Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots \r\n               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Okay, let's go.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                              (to Artoo)\r\n                         Now, don't you forget this! Why I \r\n                         should stick my neck out for you is \r\n                         quite beyond my capacity!\r\n\r\n               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful \r\n               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers \r\n               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the \r\n               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery \r\n               with a cord to his face.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Thank the maker! This oil bath is \r\n                         going to feel so good. I've got such \r\n                         a bad case of dust contamination, I \r\n                         can barely move!\r\n\r\n               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought \r\n               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man \r\n               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. \r\n               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he \r\n               slams a wrench across the workbench.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is \r\n                         right. I'm never gonna get out of \r\n                         here!\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Is there anything I might do to help?\r\n\r\n               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains \r\n               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Well, not unless you can alter time, \r\n                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me \r\n                         off this rock!\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a \r\n                         droid and not very knowledgeable \r\n                         about such things. Not on this planet, \r\n                         anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm \r\n                         not even sure which planet I'm on.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Well, if there's a bright center to \r\n                         the universe, you're on the planet \r\n                         that it's farthest from.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I see, sir.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Uh, you can call me Luke.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I see, sir Luke.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                              (laughing)\r\n                         Just Luke.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg \r\n                         relations, and this is my counterpart, \r\n                         Artoo-Detoo.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Hello.\r\n\r\n               Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to \r\n               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome \r\n               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping \r\n               oil from his bronze body.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here. \r\n                         It looks like you boys have seen a \r\n                         lot of action.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         With all we've been through, sometimes \r\n                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition \r\n                         as we are, what with the Rebellion \r\n                         and all.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         You know of the Rebellion against \r\n                         the Empire?\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         That's how we came to be in your \r\n                         service, if you take my meaning, \r\n                         sir.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Have you been in many battles?\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Several, I think. Actually, there's \r\n                         not much to tell. I'm not much more \r\n                         than an interpreter, and not very \r\n                         good at telling stories. Well, not \r\n                         at making them interesting, anyways.\r\n\r\n               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's \r\n               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Well, my little friend, you've got \r\n                         something jammed in here real good. \r\n                         Were you on a cruiser or...\r\n\r\n               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling \r\n               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\r\n               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being \r\n               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a \r\n               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly \r\n               lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment \r\n               over and over.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         What is what?!?

He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer \r\n               for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the \r\n               sentence fragment over and over.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Merely \r\n                         a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no \r\n                         mind.\r\n\r\n               Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Who is she?

A person of some \r\n                         importance, sir -- I believe.

You're going \r\n                         to get us in trouble. It's all right, \r\n                         you can trust him. He's our new \r\n                         master.\r\n\r\n               Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         He says he's the property of Obi-Wan \r\n                         Kenobi, a resident of these parts. \r\n                         And it's a private message for him. \r\n                         Quite frankly, sir I don't know what \r\n                         he's talking about. Our last master \r\n                         was Captain Antilles, but with what \r\n                         we've been through, this little R2 \r\n                         unit has become a bit eccentric.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Obi-Wan Kenobi?

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY\r\n\r\n               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and \r\n               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the \r\n               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young \r\n               adventurer.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         There are two Banthas down there but \r\n                         I don't see any... wait a second, \r\n                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can \r\n                         see one of them now.\r\n\r\n               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his \r\n               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of \r\n               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, \r\n               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled \r\n               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be \r\n               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles \r\n               down the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed \r\n               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in \r\n               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block \r\n               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. \r\n               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced \r\n               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands \r\n               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible \r\n               shrieking laugh.\r\n\r\n               EXT.

The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts \r\n               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then \r\n               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan \r\n               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the \r\n               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.\r\n\r\n               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight \r\n               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even \r\n               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and \r\n               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and \r\n               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating \r\n               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes \r\n               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a \r\n               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Hello there!

He looks around.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Threepio!\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY\r\n\r\n               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins \r\n               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and \r\n               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half \r\n               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\r\n\r\n               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then \r\n               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally \r\n               the mechanical man's systems turn on.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Where am I?

Ben glances around \r\n               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the \r\n               air.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.\r\n\r\n               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING\r\n\r\n               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but \r\n               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and \r\n               security.

Which reminds me...\r\n\r\n               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  \r\n               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the \r\n               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  \r\n               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the \r\n               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle \r\n               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         I have something here for you.

A long beam shoots out \r\n               about four feet and flickers there.

The murky, moldy \r\n               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic \r\n               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At \r\n               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, \r\n               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over \r\n               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group \r\n               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender \r\n               stops Luke and the robots.\r\n\r\n                                     BARTENDER\r\n                         We don't serve their kind here!\r\n\r\n               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many \r\n               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's \r\n               drift.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         What?\r\n\r\n                                     BARTENDER\r\n                         Your droids. They'll have to wait \r\n                         outside. We don't want them here.\r\n\r\n               Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the \r\n               Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures \r\n               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.\r\n\r\n               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Listen, why don't you wait out by \r\n                         the speeder. We don't want any \r\n                         trouble.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I heartily agree with you sir.\r\n\r\n               Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the \r\n               creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.\r\n\r\n               Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-\r\n               looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with \r\n               fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\r\n               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \r\n               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \r\n               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a \r\n               sight to behold.\r\n\r\n               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times \r\n               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets \r\n               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit \r\n               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between \r\n               Ben and the giant Wookiee.\r\n\r\n               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips \r\n               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear \r\n               or whatever.\r\n\r\n               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\r\n\r\n                                     CREATURE\r\n                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\r\n\r\n               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore \r\n               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby \r\n               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the \r\n               belligerent monstrosity.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         He doesn't like you.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         I don't like you either.\r\n\r\n               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some \r\n               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young \r\n               adventurer.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         Don't insult us. You just watch \r\n                         yourself. We're wanted men. I have \r\n                         the death sentence in twelve systems.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         I'll be careful than.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         You'll be dead.\r\n\r\n               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar \r\n               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His \r\n               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind \r\n               Luke.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         This little one isn't worth the \r\n                         effort. Come let me buy you \r\n                         something...\r\n\r\n               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young \r\n               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables \r\n               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. \r\n               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked \r\n               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. \r\n               The bartender panics.\r\n\r\n                                     BARTENDER\r\n                         No blasters! No blaster!\r\n\r\n               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life \r\n               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut \r\n               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \r\n               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \r\n               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \r\n               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \r\n               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \r\n               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \r\n               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \r\n               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \r\n               points the the Wookiee.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         This is Chewbacca.

Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years \r\n               old.

A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's \r\n               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. \r\n               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and \r\n               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         He made a fair move.

A humming lightsaber is held high over his \r\n               head.

The ball floats to one side of \r\n               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift \r\n               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't \r\n               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, \r\n               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood \r\n               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing \r\n               him to tumble over.

The ball shoots straight up in the air, then \r\n               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly \r\n               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits \r\n               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful \r\n               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Stretch out with your feelings.\r\n\r\n               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes \r\n               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the \r\n               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original \r\n               position.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         You see, you can do it.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                         I call it luck.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         In my experience, there's no such \r\n                         thing as luck.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                         Look, going good against remotes is \r\n                         one thing.

The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and \r\n               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main \r\n               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot \r\n               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end \r\n               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then \r\n               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting \r\n               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. \r\n               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.\r\n\r\n               INT.

The giant Wookiee and his two guards \r\n               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates \r\n               are everywhere.

I'll have to clear \r\n                         it.\r\n\r\n               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in \r\n               the information. There are only three other troopers in the \r\n               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the \r\n               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of \r\n               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\r\n\r\n               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \r\n               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                         Look out!

Luke and \r\n               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \r\n               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \r\n               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \r\n               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \r\n               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \r\n               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \r\n               system, which is screeching questions about what is going \r\n               on.

The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. \r\n               The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. \r\n               The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading \r\n               to a control panel that connects two large cables.

Ben instantly \r\n               slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few \r\n               feet of him.\r\n\r\n                                     OFFICER\r\n                         Secure this area until the alert is \r\n                         canceled.\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         Give me regular reports.\r\n\r\n               All but two of the stormtroopers leave.\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         Do you know what's going on?\r\n\r\n                                     SECOND TROOPER\r\n                         Maybe it's another drill.\r\n\r\n               Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers \r\n               as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand \r\n               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the \r\n               other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips \r\n               past the troopers and into the main hallway.\r\n\r\n                                     SECOND TROOPER\r\n                         What was that?\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         Oh, it's nothing.

Troopers \r\n               are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                              (looking at his ship)\r\n                         There she is.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         See-Threepio, do you copy?\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                              (voice)\r\n                         For the moment.

Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and \r\n               points out the window to the ship.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         You came in that thing?

Come on!\r\n\r\n               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the \r\n               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty \r\n               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are \r\n               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         It's them! Blast them!\r\n\r\n               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges \r\n               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the \r\n               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down \r\n               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                              (to Luke and Leia)\r\n                         Get back to the ship!\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Where are you going?

Come on!\r\n\r\n               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for \r\n               muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke \r\n               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is \r\n               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a \r\n               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few \r\n               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops \r\n               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are \r\n               moving into an attack position in front of the lone \r\n               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops \r\n               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt \r\n               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of \r\n               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate \r\n               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of \r\n               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running \r\n               the other way also.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down \r\n               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They \r\n               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an \r\n               open hatchway.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT\r\n\r\n               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge \r\n               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. \r\n               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, \r\n               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance \r\n               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of \r\n               his arm and pulls him back.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                              (gasping)\r\n                         I think we took a wrong turn.\r\n\r\n               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby \r\n               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at \r\n               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch \r\n               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving \r\n               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  \r\n               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         There's no lock!\r\n\r\n               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         That oughta hold it for a while.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Quick, we've got to get across.

Luke aims his laser pistol \r\n               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \r\n               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops \r\n               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, \r\n               and grabs at his chest.\r\n\r\n               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by \r\n               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move \r\n               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Here, hold this.\r\n\r\n               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. \r\n               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge \r\n               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the \r\n               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears \r\n               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \r\n               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \r\n               of more troops.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Here they come!\r\n\r\n               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \r\n               he falls into the abyss.

Vader \r\n               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings \r\n               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to \r\n               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\r\n\r\n               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts \r\n               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene \r\n               look on his face.\r\n\r\n               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's \r\n               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  \r\n               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the \r\n               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers \r\n               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two \r\n               and starts for him.

Three troopers charge \r\n               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close \r\n               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the \r\n               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his \r\n               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, \r\n               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship.

MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA\r\n\r\n               Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display.

The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, \r\n               navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is \r\n               listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and \r\n               Chewbacca are standing near the back.\r\n\r\n                                     DODONNA\r\n                         The battle station is heavily shielded \r\n                         and carries a firepower greater than \r\n                         half the star fleet.

A small one-man fighter \r\n                         should be able to penetrate the outer \r\n                         defense.\r\n\r\n               Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands \r\n               and addresses Dodonna.\r\n\r\n                                     GOLD LEADER\r\n                         Pardon me for asking, sir, but what \r\n                         good are snub fighters going to be \r\n                         against that?\r\n\r\n                                     DODONNA\r\n                         Well, the Empire doesn't consider a \r\n                         small one-man fighter to be any \r\n                         threat, or they'd have a tighter \r\n                         defense. An analysis of the plans \r\n                         provided by Princess Leia has \r\n                         demonstrated a weakness in the battle \r\n                         station.\r\n\r\n               Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping \r\n               sounds, and turns his head from right to left.\r\n\r\n                                     DODONNA\r\n                         The approach will not be easy.

The target area is \r\n                         only two meters wide. It's a small \r\n                         thermal exhaust port, right below \r\n                         the main port. The shaft leads \r\n                         directly to the reactor system. A \r\n                         precise hit will start a chain \r\n                         reaction which should destroy the \r\n                         station.\r\n\r\n               A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.\r\n\r\n                                     DODONNA\r\n                         Only a precise hit will set up a \r\n                         chain reaction. The shaft is ray-\r\n                         shielded, so you'll have to use proton \r\n                         torpedoes.\r\n\r\n               Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about \r\n               sixteen years old.\r\n\r\n                                     WEDGE\r\n                         That's impossible, even for a \r\n                         computer.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         It's not impossible.

That little droid \r\n                         and I have been through a lot \r\n                         together.\r\n                              (to Artoo)\r\n                         You okay, Artoo?\r\n\r\n               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of \r\n               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps \r\n               that he is fine.\r\n\r\n               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an \r\n               his helmet.

It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo \r\n               beeps good-bye.\r\n\r\n                                     CHIEF\r\n                         Okay, easy she goes!\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to \r\n                         come back.\r\n\r\n               Artoo beeps in agreement.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         You wouldn't want my life to get \r\n                         boring, would you?\r\n\r\n               Artoo whistles his reply.\r\n\r\n               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  \r\n               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the \r\n               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The \r\n               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted \r\n               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses \r\n               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit \r\n               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, \r\n               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace \r\n               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN'S VOICE\r\n                         Luke, the Force will be with you.\r\n\r\n               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.\r\n\r\n               EXT.

From \r\n               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired \r\n               Artoo-Detoo.

Dodonna and several other \r\n               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is \r\n               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  \r\n               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck.

The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \r\n               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \r\n               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \r\n               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \r\n               arms and faces.\r\n\r\n               An explosion hits near the robots.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I should have known better than to \r\n                         trust the logic of a half-sized \r\n                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...\r\n\r\n               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \r\n               around the two hapless robots.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\r\n\r\n               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \r\n               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \r\n               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \r\n               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \r\n               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \r\n               lad with a prize-winning smile.\r\n\r\n               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \r\n               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \r\n               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \r\n               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \r\n               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \r\n               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \r\n               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \r\n               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \r\n               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \r\n               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \r\n               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \r\n               tiny robot to follow him.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you \r\n                         waiting for?! Get in gear!\r\n\r\n               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \r\n               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \r\n               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \r\n               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \r\n               madly.\r\n\r\n               INT.

This is \r\n               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \r\n               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \r\n               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \r\n               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \r\n               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \r\n               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \r\n               in a frenzied panic.\r\n\r\n               INT.

A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \r\n               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, \r\n               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting \r\n               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little \r\n               robot joins his companion.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         At last!

They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader \r\n               emerges from the shadows.

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET\r\n\r\n               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange \r\n               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures \r\n               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \r\n               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \r\n               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \r\n               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\r\n\r\n               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \r\n               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \r\n               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \r\n               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \r\n               narrow path.\r\n\r\n               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \r\n               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \r\n               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \r\n               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \r\n               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \r\n               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \r\n               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \r\n               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \r\n               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \r\n               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \r\n               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \r\n               the trail.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\r\n\r\n               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\r\n               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \r\n               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \r\n               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \r\n               is sucked into the giant machine.\r\n\r\n               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \r\n               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\r\n\r\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\r\n\r\n               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \r\n               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \r\n               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty \r\n               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \r\n               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \r\n               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \r\n               of the chamber.\r\n\r\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\r\n\r\n               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \r\n               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \r\n               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, \r\n               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \r\n               out from the gloom.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!\r\n\r\n               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\r\n\r\n               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent \r\n               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain \r\n               ridge.\r\n\r\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY\r\n\r\n               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\r\n               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. \r\n               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks \r\n                         go off in this direction.\r\n\r\n               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand \r\n               and gives it to the first trooper.\r\n\r\n                                     SECOND TROOPER\r\n                         Look, sir -- droids.\r\n\r\n               EXT.

SANDCRAWLER\r\n\r\n               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped \r\n               prison chamber.

Wake up!\r\n\r\n               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, \r\n               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  \r\n               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights \r\n               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long \r\n               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding \r\n               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the \r\n               odd assortment of robots.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         We're doomed.\r\n\r\n               A Jawa starts moving toward them.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Do you think they'll melt us down?\r\n\r\n               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Don't shoot!

His reddish eyes are \r\n               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \r\n               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \r\n               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \r\n               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \r\n               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\r\n\r\n               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \r\n               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru \r\n               standing in the main courtyard.\r\n\r\n                                     BERU\r\n                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a \r\n                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         It looks like we don't have much of \r\n                         a choice but I'll remind him.\r\n\r\n               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment \r\n               for sale with the Jawa leader.\r\n\r\n                                     OWEN\r\n                         I have no need for a protocol droid.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                              (quickly)\r\n                         Sir -- not in an environment such as \r\n                         this -- that's why I've also been \r\n                         programmed for over thirty secondary \r\n                         functions that...\r\n\r\n                                     OWEN\r\n                         What I really need is a droid that \r\n                         understands the binary language of \r\n                         moisture vaporators.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Vaporators!

Well, come on, Red, let's \r\n                         go.\r\n\r\n               As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back \r\n               into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep \r\n               and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained \r\n               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\r\n\r\n               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two \r\n               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the \r\n               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Uncle Owen...\r\n\r\n                                     OWEN\r\n                         Yeah?\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. \r\n                         Look!\r\n\r\n                                     OWEN\r\n                              (to the head Jawa)\r\n                         Hey, what're you trying to push on \r\n                         us?\r\n\r\n               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked \r\n               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract \r\n               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps \r\n               Luke on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                              (pointing to Artoo)\r\n                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is \r\n                         in prime condition.

LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful \r\n               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers \r\n               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the \r\n               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery \r\n               with a cord to his face.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Thank the maker! This oil bath is \r\n                         going to feel so good. I've got such \r\n                         a bad case of dust contamination, I \r\n                         can barely move!\r\n\r\n               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought \r\n               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man \r\n               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. \r\n               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he \r\n               slams a wrench across the workbench.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is \r\n                         right. I'm never gonna get out of \r\n                         here!\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Is there anything I might do to help?\r\n\r\n               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains \r\n               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Well, not unless you can alter time, \r\n                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me \r\n                         off this rock!\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a \r\n                         droid and not very knowledgeable \r\n                         about such things. Not on this planet, \r\n                         anyways.

Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to \r\n               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome \r\n               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping \r\n               oil from his bronze body.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here. \r\n                         It looks like you boys have seen a \r\n                         lot of action.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         With all we've been through, sometimes \r\n                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition \r\n                         as we are, what with the Rebellion \r\n                         and all.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         You know of the Rebellion against \r\n                         the Empire?\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         That's how we came to be in your \r\n                         service, if you take my meaning, \r\n                         sir.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Have you been in many battles?\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Several, I think. Actually, there's \r\n                         not much to tell. I'm not much more \r\n                         than an interpreter, and not very \r\n                         good at telling stories. Well, not \r\n                         at making them interesting, anyways.\r\n\r\n               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's \r\n               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Well, my little friend, you've got \r\n                         something jammed in here real good. \r\n                         Were you on a cruiser or...\r\n\r\n               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling \r\n               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\r\n               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being \r\n               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a \r\n               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly \r\n               lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment \r\n               over and over.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         What is what?!?

Suddenly something huge moves in front of \r\n               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, \r\n               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled \r\n               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be \r\n               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles \r\n               down the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed \r\n               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in \r\n               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block \r\n               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. \r\n               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced \r\n               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands \r\n               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible \r\n               shrieking laugh.\r\n\r\n               EXT.

The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts \r\n               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then \r\n               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan \r\n               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the \r\n               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.\r\n\r\n               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight \r\n               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even \r\n               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and \r\n               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and \r\n               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating \r\n               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes \r\n               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a \r\n               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Hello there!

He claims to be the \r\n                         property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he \r\n                         a relative of yours? Do you know who \r\n                         he's talking about?\r\n\r\n               Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Obi-Wan Kenobi...

He's me! I haven't gone by the \r\n                         name Obi-Wan since oh, before you \r\n                         were born.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Then the droid does belong to you.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Don't seem to remember ever owning a \r\n                         droid. Very interesting...\r\n\r\n               He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         I think we better get indoors.

Artoo lets out a pathetic \r\n               beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Threepio!\r\n\r\n               EXT.

Luke and \r\n               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half \r\n               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\r\n\r\n               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then \r\n               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally \r\n               the mechanical man's systems turn on.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Where am I?

You go \r\n                         on, Master Luke. There's no sense in \r\n                         you risking yourself on my account. \r\n                         I'm done for.\r\n\r\n               Artoo makes a beeping sound.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         No, you're not. What kind of talk is \r\n                         that?\r\n\r\n               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little \r\n               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around \r\n               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the \r\n               air.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.\r\n\r\n               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING\r\n\r\n               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but \r\n               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and \r\n               security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as \r\n               old Ben sits thinking.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         No, my father didn't fight in the \r\n                         wars.

Which reminds me...\r\n\r\n               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  \r\n               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the \r\n               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  \r\n               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the \r\n               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle \r\n               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         I have something here for you.

He feared you \r\n                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some \r\n                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like \r\n                         your father did.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me, \r\n                         I'll close down for awhile.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Sure, go ahead.\r\n\r\n               Ben hands Luke the saber.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         What is it?\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Your fathers lightsaber.

A long beam shoots out \r\n               about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across \r\n               the ceiling.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         An elegant weapon for a more civilized \r\n                         time.

The murky, moldy \r\n               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic \r\n               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At \r\n               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, \r\n               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over \r\n               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group \r\n               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender \r\n               stops Luke and the robots.\r\n\r\n                                     BARTENDER\r\n                         We don't serve their kind here!\r\n\r\n               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many \r\n               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's \r\n               drift.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         What?\r\n\r\n                                     BARTENDER\r\n                         Your droids.

He notices several of the gruesome creatures \r\n               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.\r\n\r\n               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Listen, why don't you wait out by \r\n                         the speeder.

His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\r\n               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \r\n               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \r\n               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a \r\n               sight to behold.\r\n\r\n               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times \r\n               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets \r\n               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit \r\n               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between \r\n               Ben and the giant Wookiee.\r\n\r\n               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips \r\n               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear \r\n               or whatever.\r\n\r\n               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\r\n\r\n                                     CREATURE\r\n                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\r\n\r\n               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore \r\n               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby \r\n               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the \r\n               belligerent monstrosity.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         He doesn't like you.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         I don't like you either.\r\n\r\n               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some \r\n               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young \r\n               adventurer.\r\n\r\n                                     HUMAN\r\n                         Don't insult us.

Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His \r\n               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind \r\n               Luke.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         This little one isn't worth the \r\n                         effort. Come let me buy you \r\n                         something...\r\n\r\n               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young \r\n               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables \r\n               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. \r\n               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked \r\n               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. \r\n               The bartender panics.\r\n\r\n                                     BARTENDER\r\n                         No blasters! No blaster!\r\n\r\n               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life \r\n               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut \r\n               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \r\n               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \r\n               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \r\n               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \r\n               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \r\n               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \r\n               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \r\n               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \r\n               points the the Wookiee.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         This is Chewbacca.

A humming lightsaber is held high over his \r\n               head.

Luke doesn't \r\n               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, \r\n               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood \r\n               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing \r\n               him to tumble over.

The ball shoots straight up in the air, then \r\n               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly \r\n               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits \r\n               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful \r\n               yell and attempts to hit the seeker.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Stretch out with your feelings.\r\n\r\n               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes \r\n               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the \r\n               bolt.

DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY\r\n\r\n               The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the \r\n               two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.\r\n\r\n                                     TROOPER\r\n                         The ship's all yours.

DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE\r\n\r\n               In a very small command office near the entrance to the \r\n               pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices \r\n               the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.\r\n\r\n                                     GANTRY OFFICER\r\n                         TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at \r\n                         your post? TX-four-one-two, do you \r\n                         copy?\r\n\r\n               A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and \r\n               waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating \r\n               his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his \r\n               head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an \r\n               annoyed look.\r\n\r\n                                     GANTRY OFFICER\r\n                         Take over.

I'll see what I can do.\r\n\r\n               As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing \r\n               the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary \r\n               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling \r\n               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. \r\n               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted \r\n               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the \r\n               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed \r\n               as a stormtrooper.

He begins to inspect it \r\n               carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  \r\n               Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         Plug in.

DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE\r\n\r\n               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits \r\n               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, \r\n               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio \r\n               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious \r\n               glance.\r\n\r\n               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.\r\n\r\n               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away \r\n               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and \r\n               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main \r\n               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot \r\n               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end \r\n               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then \r\n               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting \r\n               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. \r\n               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY \r\n               AREA\r\n\r\n               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door \r\n               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards \r\n               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates \r\n               are everywhere.

I'll have to clear \r\n                         it.\r\n\r\n               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in \r\n               the information. There are only three other troopers in the \r\n               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the \r\n               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of \r\n               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\r\n\r\n               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \r\n               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                         Look out!

Luke and \r\n               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \r\n               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \r\n               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \r\n               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \r\n               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \r\n               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \r\n               system, which is screeching questions about what is going \r\n               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                         We've got to find out which cell \r\n                         this princess of yours is in.

Han and Chewbacca \r\n               are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far \r\n               and of the hallway.

Get in there!\r\n\r\n               Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires \r\n               off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then \r\n               slides into the chute himself and is gone.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM\r\n\r\n               Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  \r\n               Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He \r\n               finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open.

The \r\n               laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  \r\n               Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes \r\n               almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a \r\n               rather grim look on her face.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Will you forget it?

Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins \r\n               to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols \r\n               drawn.

A membrane tentacle is wrapped around \r\n               his throat.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Luke!\r\n\r\n               Leia extends a long pipe toward him.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Blast it, will you!

Then everything is deathly quiet.  \r\n               Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca \r\n               howls in the corner.

Artoo and \r\n               Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great \r\n               explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the \r\n               floor.

Ben gestures with his hand \r\n               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the \r\n               other hallway.

Come on!\r\n\r\n               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the \r\n               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty \r\n               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are \r\n               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.\r\n\r\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\r\n                         It's them! Blast them!\r\n\r\n               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges \r\n               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the \r\n               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down \r\n               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.\r\n\r\n                                     HAN\r\n                              (to Luke and Leia)\r\n                         Get back to the ship!\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Where are you going?

Luke \r\n               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is \r\n               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a \r\n               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few \r\n               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops \r\n               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are \r\n               moving into an attack position in front of the lone \r\n               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops \r\n               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt \r\n               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of \r\n               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate \r\n               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of \r\n               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running \r\n               the other way also.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\r\n\r\n               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down \r\n               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They \r\n               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an \r\n               open hatchway.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT\r\n\r\n               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge \r\n               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. \r\n               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, \r\n               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance \r\n               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of \r\n               his arm and pulls him back.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                              (gasping)\r\n                         I think we took a wrong turn.\r\n\r\n               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby \r\n               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at \r\n               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch \r\n               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving \r\n               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  \r\n               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         There's no lock!\r\n\r\n               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         That oughta hold it for a while.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Quick, we've got to get across.

Luke aims his laser pistol \r\n               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \r\n               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops \r\n               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, \r\n               and grabs at his chest.\r\n\r\n               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by \r\n               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move \r\n               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\r\n\r\n                                     LUKE\r\n                         Here, hold this.\r\n\r\n               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. \r\n               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge \r\n               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the \r\n               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears \r\n               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \r\n               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \r\n               of more troops.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         Here they come!\r\n\r\n               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \r\n               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the \r\n               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He \r\n               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the \r\n               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him \r\n               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.\r\n\r\n                                     LEIA\r\n                         For luck!\r\n\r\n               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss \r\n               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as \r\n               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the \r\n               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at \r\n               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into \r\n               the tiny subhallway.\r\n\r\n               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY\r\n\r\n               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several \r\n               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks \r\n               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the \r\n               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of \r\n               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.\r\n\r\n               INT.

Just before he reaches the hangar, \r\n               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not \r\n               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber.

Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, \r\n               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He \r\n               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.\r\n\r\n               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked \r\n               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke \r\n               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's \r\n               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark \r\n               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. \r\n               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments \r\n               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing \r\n               sound.\r\n\r\n                                     VADER\r\n                         Your powers are weak, old man.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN\r\n                         You can't win, Darth.

Vader \r\n               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings \r\n               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to \r\n               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\r\n\r\n               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts \r\n               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene \r\n               look on his face.\r\n\r\n               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's \r\n               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  \r\n               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the \r\n               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers \r\n               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two \r\n               and starts for him.

Three troopers charge \r\n               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close \r\n               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the \r\n               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his \r\n               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, \r\n               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship.

Now a part of \r\n               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps \r\n               that he is fine.\r\n\r\n               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an \r\n               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive \r\n               hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner \r\n               into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo \r\n               beeps good-bye.\r\n\r\n                                     CHIEF\r\n                         Okay, easy she goes!\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to \r\n                         come back.\r\n\r\n               Artoo beeps in agreement.\r\n\r\n                                     THREEPIO\r\n                         You wouldn't want my life to get \r\n                         boring, would you?\r\n\r\n               Artoo whistles his reply.\r\n\r\n               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  \r\n               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the \r\n               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The \r\n               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted \r\n               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses \r\n               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit \r\n               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, \r\n               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace \r\n               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.\r\n\r\n                                     BEN'S VOICE\r\n                         Luke, the Force will be with you.\r\n\r\n               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.\r\n\r\n               EXT.
